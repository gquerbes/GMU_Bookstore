	Rubin, B. (2015, November 30). Amazon, the king of e-commerce, gets primed for 2016 - CNET. Retrieved November 30, 2015, from http://www.cnet.com/news/amazon-the-king-of-e-commerce-gets-primed-for-2016/  
	 
	The author of this article states that Amazon’s Prime membership service has helped the company continue to dominate online shopping industry. He states that if it weren’t for Prime, Amazon might have been just the name of a river. The author also talked about the latest services that Amazon is providing right now, which is the expansion of Prime Now. Prime Now offers one-and two-hour deliveries of items including toilet paper, TVs, and (in some cities) restaurant food and alcohol. 
	 
	Evaluation: 
	I agree with the author, I feel like Amazon is dominating the online shopping industry. A few months ago, Amazon launched their new sale holiday called Prime Day. It’s similar to Cyber Monday, where great deals and discounts are offered on to Prime members.

	During the Cyber Monday sale holiday, Target and Paypal Sites report problem. The author mentions in her article that Cyber Monday, the online version of Black Friday, is not immune to traffic jams of shoppers rushing to take advantage of post-Thanksgiving sales. Shoppers were for a period of time unable to gain access to the site Target, ad Paypal.  
	 
	I agree with the author completely, as this news has been trending in all blogging journals. Infact, I had similar problem with Paypal as well, as I was trying to buy some items that uses check-out system via PayPal.
